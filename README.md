# moduit-qa-automation-alif
QA AUTOMATION CANDIDATE - MUHAMMAD NUR ALIF

This repository is developed by using Selenium and Java with Maven Builder.
To run, simply go to ui_test directory, and use "mvn compile test"

For the newman, use "newman run Moduit.postman_collection.json -e reqres.in.postman_environment.json -r htmlextra"

On the API test, it is not possible to store the created data in reqres.in. So I mock them just using userID=2.

You can see the latest running workflow to check the workflow.

Thank you.
